# Embassy-Collecting-Scripts

Destiny's scripts used for embassy collecting. 

There's no need for this to be rate-limited, as this makes only one request to the API. The link opener is fairly self-explanatory, but be warned. It starts from OLDEST to NEWEST, meaning it will start from the regions that were first founded (most likely feeders). More features, like excluding regions based on tags are planned, and an option to start from newest to oldest are on the to-do list. You can also add your own regions to the txt file, with each region separated by a comma.

For the Embassy Keybind, once the links are opened, press r to go to the region admin page, then press r again to send an embassy request. To install this on chrome, you need to go click the three dots, click on more tools, then click on extensions. Then click load unpacked and select the entire "Embassy Keybind Folder". If you had a page already open prior to installing this extension, be sure to refresh it.
